## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including `next` and `react`. If you encounter any dependency conflicts, you can use the following command:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This runs development server to see how it looks etc.
```
npm run dev
